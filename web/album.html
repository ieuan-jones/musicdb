                <p>I actually think this is a very good album tbh. Of course, A Rush of Blood to the Head is superior, but comparing against perfection is never a fair thing, this album would be remarkable if by any other artist. But here it's a little meh. Is how it is tbh but y'know.</p>
                <p>In reality, X & Y was the peak of Coldplay's reign. We all long for the days that they return to that sort of class. And songs like Yellow are an excellent cure for insomnia. But sometimes the album that kicks off a very good artist's career has to be looked at in a positive light, even if it's really a bit of a let down.</p>
                <p>And even whilst X & Y and A Rush of Blood to the Head are to be considered by all definition good albums, they still don't compare to such wonderful acts as Stereophonics and Catatonia, who were at one point their contemporaries and yet not so well remembered. Clear cut racism against the Welsh that is, but what can one do about it?</p>
